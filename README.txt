PROJECT: CLOCKS AS NON LINEAR PACEMAKERS - NUMERICAL SIMULATIONS

DATE: June - July of 2018.
CREATOR: Diego Alejandro Herrera.

TO: Thomas Dittrich (Unal).

DESCRIPTION: The present repository cntains numerical simulations necessary for
	     the completion of the article "Escapements As Non Linear Pace Ma-
	     kers.". It contains algorithms, graphics and datafiles related to
	     the dynamical models proposed on the article.

CONTENTS: The repository is divided in 5 branches that contains all the files
	  necessary to recreate simulations, and use on the article if desired:

	  1) Master: Contains descriptive files.
	  2) Codes: Contains algorithms simplemented in C++. 
	  3) SimplePendullum: Contains Files realted to First Model.
	  4) ClockEscapement: Contains Files realted to Second Model.
	  6) Tests: Used for data generation.

	  Branches 3 and 4 contain two folders: datafiles and graphics. The
	  names are very descriptive.

IMPORTANT: Before downloading or commiting changes ask creator of repository
	   via e-mail: dieaherreraroj.unal.edu.co
