PROJECT: CLOCKS AS NON LINEAR PACEMAKERS - NUMERICAL SIMULATIONS

DATE: June - July of 2018.
CREATOR: Diego Alejandro Herrera.

DESCRIPTION: The present repository cntains numerical simulations necessary for
	     the completion of the article "Escapements As Non Linear Pace Ma-
	     kers.". It contains algorithms, graphics and datafiles related to
	     the dynamical models proposed on the article.

CONTENTS: The repository is divided in 4 branches that contains all the files
	  necessary to recreate simulations, and use on the article if desired:

	  1) Master: Contains descriptive files.
	  2) Codes: Contains algorithm simplemented in C++
	  3) Datafiles: Contains datafiles where simulation data is stored
	  4) Graphics: Contains graphics to illustrate article.
